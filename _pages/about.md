Hi, I'm Amine. I am currently an Associate Scientist in Data Science & AI at Moderna, conducting research at the intersection of Machine Learning and Genomics. I also work on developing Computer Vision methods and contribute to Protein Engineering projects.

I like writing about ML for biology, from hands-on takeaways that move projects forward to concise deep dives that clarify the underlying ideas.

Stay tuned!
